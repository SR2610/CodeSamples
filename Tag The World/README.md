University Game Design Assessment - Creating a prototype for a game designed as a group.

A free running, spray painting game.  A short demonstration can be found [here.](https://youtu.be/9hqB8XZkUA0?t=119)

In this group work my primary contribution was the climbing and movement controls.

## Code Functions
* Player Body - Handles the collision and movement for the player, allows thjem to walk around with the joystick / touchpad on the controllers.
* Player Hands - Used for Handling interaction with objects in the world.
* Player Climbing - Script that allows the player to climb on any surface tagged as being climbable, pulls them around by the direction that they pull in real life.
